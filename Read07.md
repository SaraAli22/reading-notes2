# CSS Associates Style rules with HTML elements
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules governhow the content of specified elements should be displayed. 
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

* **Selectors:** indicate which element the rule applies to. 
The same rule can apply to more than one element if you 
separate the element names with commas.

* **Declarations:** indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and a value), and are separated by a colon.

** CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts:**
a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.

h1, h2, h3 {font-family: Arial;color: yellow;}

* Properties: indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.


* Values :specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value is the color you want the text in these elements to be.


INTRODUCING CSS
1. CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.

2. Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).

3.  Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.

4. Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

5. CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, 
although they may appear within an HTML page.
