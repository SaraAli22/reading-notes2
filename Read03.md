**3.Process& Design**
This section discusses a process that
you can use when you are creating a new
website.

It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.
