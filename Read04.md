**How do I write a script for a web page ?**
* It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript 
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and 
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. 

* The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

* If you view the source code of the page in the browser, 
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, 
because the script works with the model of the web 
page that the browser has created.

## STATEMENTS
** A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement ,Statements should end with a semicolon.**

 ### COMMENTS
 **You should write comments to explain what your code does. 
They help make your code easier to read and understand. 
This can help you and others who read your code. **

### VARIABLE
**A script will have to temporarily store the bits of information it needs to do its job. It can store this 
data in variables.**

### DATA TYPES
** JavaScript distinguishes between numbers, strings, and true or false values known as Booleans.**
