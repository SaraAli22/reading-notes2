# Images
* The img element is used to add images to a web page.

* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

# Color
## Understanding Color :
Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.

Computer monitors are made
up of thousands of tiny squares
called pixels (if you look very
closely at your monitor you
should be able to see them).

When the screen is not turned
on, it's black because it's not
emitting any light. When it's
on, each pixel can be a different
color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the
screen is expressed in terms of
a mix of red, green, and blue -just like on a television screen.

1. RGB Values Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.

2. Hex Codes Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in
hexadecimal code.

3. Color Names Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.

4. Hue Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.

 5. Saturation Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturation, the color would be mostly gray.

 6. Brigh tness Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color. At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.

 ## HSL Colors
 1. hue Hue is the colloquial idea of color. In HSL colors, hue is often represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color, although it may also be
shown as a slider with values
from 0 to 360.

 2. saturation Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of gray.

 3. lightness Lightness is the amount of white (lightness) or black (darkness) in a color. Lightness is represented as a percentage. 0% lightness is black, 100% lightness is white, and 50% lightness is normal. Lightness is sometimes referred to as luminosity.

 * Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.

* There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names.

* Color pickers can help you find the color you want.

* It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).

* CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.

* CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

# Text
## Typeface Terminology

* Serif Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs.

* Sans-Serif Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design.

* Monospace Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing.

* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.

* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

* You can control the space between lines of text,individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.

* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.

# JPEG vs PNG vs GIF — which image format to use and when?
As government communicators, often we have to work with design in all formats, especially digital design. But when you need to throw a picture up on your website, into an email, or send out in a social media post, is it a quick and easy process? Do you know the different effects something as simple as a file format can have on the look and feel of your communications?

We’ve compiled some background on the ins and outs of the three major image formats for Web design to help you do your job quicker and easier.

When dealing with digital design, there are only a handful of file formats we have to concern ourselves with. The three main file types used for digital use are .PNG, .JPG, and .GIF. There are some pretty big differences as to which file type would be appropriate for your current project, and choosing the right one can make all the difference in the world. Knowing which format to use can save a lot of time and prevent you from having to make any changes after the file is sent or uploaded.

.JPG
The standard “go to” file format at the moment is .JPG. However, the uses in which .JPG would be preferable over a .PNG are a lot more limited. The .JPG format is best used in the case of complex images with no text. By its nature, .JPG reduces loading times by selectively deleting elements of a photo. This is great for large detailed photographs that would otherwise take very long to load. When done to an image with elements that utilize sharp and straight edges, pixilation around these areas become very apparent, making text range from unpleasant to unreadable depending on the size. To avoid this, stick to using .JPG for very detailed images that don’t feature text or other hard-edged graphics.


.PNG
The .PNG file format is what we would most often use in digital design projects. The .PNG, or Portable Network Graphic, tends to have a larger file size than the other two formats, but it also preserves hard edges and can handle a high amount of colors while keeping the load time fast enough to use online. Another interesting capability is that it can be saved on a transparency. This means we can utilize the important elements of an image without needing to change things like a background color if we placed it on transparency. This is a big reason why most major sites create their logo as a .PNG, so it doesn’t need to change whenever their site is updated. Best uses for .PNG include images that contain text, graphics with hard edges, and elements that require transparent backgrounds like logos.


.GIF
The .GIF file format is essentially the faster loading cousin of .PNG with one catch—the image needs to be under exactly 256 colors. This limits designers a lot more than you’d think. You should only use this file format for low-resolution images. So elements like photographs or graphics that use gradients would immediately be out of the question for the .GIF format. But elements like solid color buttons or banners are ideal as these will (usually) load faster than the .PNG version, while keeping all the cool features like transparencies and preserving hard edges. Another awesome feature that only .GIFs can utilize is animation. So you can create a graphic that utilizes a short looping or single play animation, which does not require any plug-ins since it’s only an image file.
