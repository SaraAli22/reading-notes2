# Read: 12 - Docs for the HTML <canvas> Element & Chart.js
Charts are far better for displaying data visually than tables and have the added benefit that no one is ever going to press-gang them into use as a layout tool. They’re easier to look at and convey data quickly, but they’re not always easy to create.



## Setting up
The first thing we need to do is download Chart.js. Copy the Chart.min.js out of the unzipped folder and into the directory you’ll be working in. Then create a new html page and import the script:

>`<!DOCTYPE html>`
`<html lang="en">`
    `<head>`
        `<meta charset="utf-8" />`
        `<title>Chart.js demo</title>`
        `<script src='Chart.min.js'></script>`
    `</head>`
    `<body>`
    `</body>`
`</html>`

### Drawing a line chart


To draw a line chart, the first thing we need to do is create a canvas element in our HTML in which Chart.js can draw our chart. So add this to the body of our HTML page:

>`<canvas id="buyers" width="600" height="400"></canvas>`

Next, we need to write a script that will retrieve the context of the canvas, so add this to the foot of your body element:

>`<script>`
    `var buyers = document.getElementById('buyers').getContext`
    `('2d');`
    `new Chart(buyers).Line(buyerData);`
`</script>`

>`var buyerData = {`
	`labels : ["January","February","March","April","May","June"],`
	`datasets : [`
		`{`
			`fillColor : "rgba(172,194,132,0.4)",`
			`strokeColor : "#ACC26D",`
			`pointColor : "#fff",`
			`pointStrokeColor : "#9DB86D",`
			`data : [203,156,99,251,305,247]`
		`}`
	`]`
`}`

### Drawing a pie chart
Our line chart is complete, so let’s move on to our pie chart. First, we need the canvas element:

>`<canvas id="countries" width="600" height="400"></canvas>`

Next, we need to get the context and to instantiate the chart:

>`var countries= document.getElementById("countries").getContext`
`("2d");`
`new Chart(countries).Pie(pieData, pieOptions);`

You’ll notice that this time, we are going to supply some options to the chart.

Next we need to create the data. This data is a little different to the line chart because the pie chart is simpler, we just need to supply a value and a color for each section:

>`var pieData = [`
	`{`
		`value: 20,`
		`color:"#878BB6"`
	`},`
	`{`
	`value : 40,`
		`color : "#4ACAB4"`
	`},`
	`{`
		`value : 10,`
		`color : "#FF8153"`
	`},`
	`{`
		`value : 30,`
		`color : "#FFEA88"`
	`}`
`];`

Now, immediately after the pieData we’ll add our options:

>`var pieOptions = {`
	`segmentShowStroke : false,`
	`animateScale : true`
`}`
